# Azure

Oliver was originally created through the St. Jude Cloud team's close collaboration with the Microsoft Genomics team and, specifically, our the development of [Cromwell on Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/cromwellonazure). As such, we intend to provide first-class support of Cromwell on Azure and common operations like debugging jobs.

The subcommand `oliver azure` currently exists for the community to try, but it is not stable enough to write a guide for. In the meantime, if you use Cromwell on Azure and would like to suggest features or report bugs you encounter, we invite you to do so on the [issues](https://github.com/stjudecloud/oliver/issues) page.
